### A simple Ransomware
This is a simple **Ransomware** written in **Python** that encrypts files and it also comes with a decryptor:)

**This was created for fun** and make sure to subscribe to [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck)

Yes, I followed NetworkChuck's tutorial lol

### To Do
 --> Rename everything to NUCLEAR
 
 --> Delete or "NUKE" all files after 10 failed attemps on the decryptor
 
 --> Convert to exe so this can run on Windows

### NOTE
This project is **made for fun** and for **educational purposes**, I am not responsible for any misuse of this project.

Dont do anything dumb Mark!!
